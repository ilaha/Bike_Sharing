- I also noticed that the busy areas rush as residential and/or tuirism areas such as Manhattan shows high number of rides as well. 


- Additionally, if we look at the weekdays, we'll notice that Monday, Tuesday and Thursday tend to be busiest in the Morning around 7-8 AM and at the afternoon around 5-6 PM, which makes sense that it's the time people go to work and come back from work. 


- Overall, from our data it appears that the idea of having the same Business In Des Moines could be very beneficial, however, we would need more data to look into the more details for revenue and etc to provide an expected approximate amount $$ to the potential Investors
